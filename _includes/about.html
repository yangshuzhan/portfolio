                I'm currently a graduate student looking for Phd. I love computer graphics and especially rendering. In the past, I worked as a 3d designer for product in a sales department. I graduated from Wuhan University with a bachelor's degree and am currently studying at Sichuan Normal University. I am currently conducting research on MCMC, and my supervisor Han Su is involved in AI related research.

                My role models include old-school programmers and <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html">hackers</a> who never make it to the mainstream news, but are responsible for most of the software that most people use on an everyday basis. I promote, support and use free and open source software to the extent possible.

                I maintain a little blog at <a href="{{ site.blog_url }}">nagekar.com</a> where I write about my recent interests and other activities. I post my software projects on <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}">GitHub</a>.
